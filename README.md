# Posture Detection and Correction

## Overview

This project aims to enhance posture detection and correction in activities like yoga and gym exercises using advanced machine learning and neural networks. We improved upon traditional CNN models by integrating real-time feedback and LSTM networks for pose sequencing.

## Problem Statement

Traditional CNN models for pose detection lack real-time sequencing and correction capabilities. Our solution facilitates real-time feedback and accurate pose sequencing for better posture management.

## Technologies Used
- **Pose Detection**: OpenPose, MediaPipe
- **Posture Correction**: MediaPipe, MoveNet
- **Pose Sequencing**: LSTM
- **Deployment**: Streamlit

Run the application:
    ```
    streamlit run üè†Ô∏è_Demo.py
    ```

## Usage

Upload a video or use a webcam for real-time posture detection and correction. The model detects key landmarks, calculates angles, and provides corrective feedback.
